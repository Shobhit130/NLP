    "corpus = [\"Although among the busiest cities in the world, given its location, Mumbai has plenty of options for those looking for a quick getaway from the hustle and bustle of the financial capital. Those looking for a lazy weekend by the sea have a long coastline to savour, while for those seeking something more adventurous, such as a hike or a trek, there are numerous spots across the Western Ghats in Maharashtra, barely a couple of hours’ drive from Mumbai.When it comes to hikes near Mumbai, there are a number of options for adventurers of all kinds – those who are veterans and welcome challenging terrain, those who have some experience and those who are just about getting started on their hiking journey. Whichever be your level of expertise, it’s easy to take on terrain of various kind if you have the correct gear. Skechers is just the kind of brand that offers up outdoor shoes which can help you tackle the rough and tumble of the great Indian outdoors.For amateur climbers, Lohagad Fort, located close to Lonavala is a great place to get started. There’s no trail, instead, all you have to do is take the steps all the way to the top of the fort. Large parts of the ancient structure are still intact, so keep an eye out for caves as you climb. From the top, the view of Pawna Lake is breathtaking, and especially in the monsoon, it’s a sight to behold. Bear in mind though, during the rains, the steps are quite slippery and can be treacherous if you aren’t careful. Although, outfitted with a pair of Skechers Bionic Trail , chances are, you’ll breeze through the entire climb up and down. It takes a couple of hours to complete the entire climb, unless you’re there on the weekend when hikers from nearby cities throng the place and the going can get quite slow. Make a day of it and also visit the nearby Bhaja Caves and Visapur Fort.\",\n",
    "\"I wake up with a start, as I feel someone tapping my shoulder. It’s the gentleman who is driving me to my destination, who has an enormous grin plastered on his face, despite the fact that I have spent the last couple of hours passed out next to him, as he has navigated us across two states. It’s time for a chai break, with another two hours left on our journey. I step out of the car and survey the surroundings. The lower Himalayas are dressed in dense foliage, lush green after the monsoon. In the distance, a lake shimmers in the autumn sun. After a refreshing drink of sweetened milk tea, we’re on our way again.We have moved off the main highway connecting Chandigarh and Manali, and the signs of noisy tourists have all but disappeared. The black strip of tarmac winds its way across little villages and towns, and the only other traffic is the occasional state-operated bus ferrying passengers from far-flung settlements to commercial centres. Before I realise it, we have pulled up at the gates of Rakkh Resort, my base for the next couple of days.Nestled in the verdant hills of Palampur, perhaps the one thing that sets apart this property is the unexpectedness of it. With hardly any visible signs of commercialisation, not once on the approach was it evident that this 25-key resort spread across 7 acres lay right around the corner.The long drive from Chandigarh having wiped me out (yes, despite my sleeping through the better part of it), I retire to my tastefully appointed cottage early.\",\n",
    "\"The summer sun is harsh, and in the middle of the Maharashtrian countryside, is a different beast altogether. The tarmac glistens in the distance, a jet-black streak cutting across the crimson face of the earth. Here in Nashik’s grape country, it seems as if the colour of wine has seeped into the earth, or vice versa. We turn off the main road, all of a sudden, making our way towards a small hill. At its base is one of only six Chandon maison (house) in the world. As I step through the gates, it’s quite evident that there’s a distinct difference from the vineyard experience quite typical of India’s wine capital.“Welcome to Chandon,” we’re greeted by a bespectacled, beaming gentleman—Kaushal Khairnar, Chandon India’s chief winemaker. Kaushal is going to be our escort for the day, and after a round of introductions, as he launches straight into a deep dive on the winemaking process at Chandon.“The brand might be renowned across the world and our quality standards uniform at all the maison but sustainability is also at the core of our philosophy and vision. One hundred per cent of the grapes that Chandon sparkling wines are made from, are sourced from local farmers.” During the sorting of the fruit, an important thing to check for is how mature it is, adds Kaushal. “There is such a thing as a point of no return. A grape horizon if you will,” he snickers at his own joke.After the sorting, the fruit is processed at temperatures under 15°C, a factor that is a differentiator for Chandon wines. After that, when extracting the juice from the fruit, in a process that is called bunch pressing, caution ought to be exercised to ensure too much pressure isn’t applied, so as to keep the extract from turning bitter. After that, it’s time for a trademark secret process carried out in massive vats which conjure up images of cartoon villains meeting a grisly albeit comical end. “All I can tell you is that it involves ion exchange and imparts the kind of quality we require from the produce,” says Kaushal, sounding almost conspiratorial.\",\n",
    "\"Imagine 40,000 frenzied football fans, cheering their teams on and witnessing the spectacle that is the FIFA World Cup, a scene familiar to anyone who has ever been to a stadium to watch a football game. Standing inside Qatar’s newly minted Stadium 974, one of the venues for FIFA 2022, it’s easy to be swayed by the force of the historic occasion that will unfold here in November.Constructed entirely out of 974 shipping containers, a play on Qatar’s international country code, the stadium represents learnings gleaned by the Qataris from the 2014 edition of the tournament held in Brazil. Much like this time, the 2014 edition saw the construction of many new football stadiums for the occasion. While many of the venues constructed at the time fell into disrepair once the tournament was concluded, the Qataris are determined not to make the same mistakes. Stadium 974 is a temporary installation and once it has served its purpose for the global tournament, it will be dismantled and transported to a location and nation where it would be needed. For now, I enjoy unfettered access to the stadium, including the stands and the box seats, which is part of a lounge with a rather enviable view of the Doha harbour.From the moment I landed in Doha, the preparations for the impending tournament have been but evident. Museums, monuments, roads, flyovers, stadiums, everything in the country is either undergoing renovation or being built from scratch. It’s no mean feat to host an event of such epic proportions, and given that it’s the first time that it is being held in the Middle East, the excitement is palpable. Be it the bazaars, the waterfront or even the business district, most public spaces are festooned with football-centric signage and decorations.\"]"
